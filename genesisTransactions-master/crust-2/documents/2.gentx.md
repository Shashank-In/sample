### Initializing the default genesis and validator files

Initialize the `commitBlockchain` validator and set the moniker. *Moniker* is a name that you set to your validator. It will generate genesis.json and config files.

`maind init <moniker of validator>`

For example, if `Commit Network` is the moniker to be set, the below command is to be used

`maind init "Commit Network" --chain-id crust-2`
